Pixel Bot written by Pixel Lab 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

.:: INTRODUCTION ::.

Pixel Bot is an IRC bot written in PHP. I will keep on developing, as it will always be one of our main projects. 
Pixel Bot has a set of scripts that connects to Internet Relay Chat as a client, and so appears to other IRC users as another user. 
Pixel bot differs from a regular client in that instead of providing interactive access to IRC for a human user, 
it performs automated functions.

.:: FEATURES ::.

!join #channel – Joins the specified IRC channel
!part #channel – Leaves the specified IRC channel
!say #channel Message – Says message in the specified IRC channel
!restart – Quits and restarts the script. (Helpful while testing the script)
!shutdown – Quits and stops the script.
